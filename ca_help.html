<h1>ConvertAll</h1>
<h2>a unit conversion program</h2>

<p>Written by Doug Bell<br>
Version 0.1.4<br>
April 18, 2018</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="background"></a>Background</h2>

<p>Why write another unit converter?  There are plenty of them out there.
Well, I couldn't find one that worked quite the way I wanted.</p>

<p>With ConvertAll, you can combine the units any way you want.  If you want
to convert from inches per decade, that's fine.  Or from meter-pounds.  Or
from cubic nautical miles.  The units don't have to make sense to anyone
else.</p>

<p>Since I'm not in the software business, I'm making this converter free for
anyone to use, both online and offline.  It also can be freely distributed and
modified, as long as it stays available under the same license terms.  If you
like the software, feel free to let others know about it.  And let me know
what you think - my email address is doug101 AT bellz DOT org</p>

<h2><a name="features"></a>Features</h2>

<ul>

  <li>The base units for conversion may be typed (with auto-completion) or
  selected from a list.</li>

  <li>As a unit is typed, the unit list is automatically filtered to show only
  units with matching words.</li>

  <li>In general, either a unit's full name or its abbreviation can be
  used.</li>

  <li>Units may be combined with the "*" and "/" operators.</li>

  <li>Units may be raised to powers (squared, cubed, etc.) with the "^"
  operator.</li>

  <li>Units in the denominator may be grouped with parenthesis.</li>

  <li>Units with non-linear scales, such as temperature, can also be
  converted.</li>

  <li>Recently used unit combinations may be picked from a menu.</li>

  <li>Numbers may be entered on either the "From" or the "To" units side, for
  conversions in both directions.</li>

  <li>Basic mathematical expressions may be entered in place of numbers.</li>

  <li>Options control the formatting of numerical results.</li>

  <li>The unit data includes over 500 units.</li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="license"></a>License</h2>

it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either Version 3 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version.</p>

<h2><a name="browser"></a>Browser Requirements</h2>

<h3><a name="online"></a>Online</h3>

<p>ConvertAll should run on most "modern" web browsers.  Here are minimum
browser version numbers:
<ul>
  <li>Chrome/Chromium 49</li>
  <li>Firefox 49</li>
  <li>Internet Explorer 11</li>
  <li>Edge 14</li>
  <li>Safari 9.1</li>
  <li>IOS Safari 9.3</li>
  <li>Android Chrome 53</li>
  <li>Opera 41</li>
</ul></p>

<p>ConvertAll has not been extensively tested with all of these browsers.
Please report any bugs.</p>

<h3><a name="offline"></a>Offline</h3>

<p>A ConvertAll zip file can be downloaded for offline use from here: <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/convertall/files/js-0.1.1/convertall-js-0.1.1.zip/download">
convertall-js-0.1.1.zip</a>.  Simply extract the files and open the
"convertall.html" file.</p>

<p>Running offline does not work with the Internet Explorer web browser.
Please choose a different browser.</p>

<h2><a name="using"></a>Using ConvertAll</h2>

<h3><a name="basics"></a>Basics</h3>

<p>Simply type a unit name in the "From Unit" edit window.  As you type, the
list below the window will be filtered to show only matching units.  Matching
unit names contain words starting with the words that are typed.  Either type
the complete unit name/abbreviation or hit the return key to use the unit
highlighted (yellow) in the list.  Of course, clicking with the mouse on a
unit in the list will also add the unit to the edit window.  You may also use
the up and down arrow keys to highlight nearby units from the list.</p>

<p>Repeat the unit selection in the "To Unit" edit window.  When done, if the
units are compatible, the numeric edit windows below the unit lists will
activate.  A number may be entered into either numeric window and the other
window will display the conversion result.</p>

<h3><a name="combine"></a>Combining Units</h3>

<p>The real strength of ConvertAll lies in its ability to combine multiple
units.  Simply type the unit names with an '*' or a '/' between them.  This
allows the entry of units such as "ft * lbf" or "mi / hr".  The '^' symbol may
be used for exponents, such as "ft^3" or "ft * lbm / sec^2".  Negative
exponents are allowed for units such as "sec^-1" (per second), but may switch
the multiplication or division symbol ("ft * sec^-2" becomes "ft /
sec^2").</p>

<p>Multiplication and division have the same precedence, so they are evaluated
left-to-right.  Parenthesis may also be used to group units in the
denominator.  So "m / sec / kg" can also be entered as "m / (sec * kg)".  The
version with parenthesis is probably less confusing.</p>

<p>The buttons below the unit text boxes can also be used to add operators to
the active unit that is closest to the cursor.  The Square and Cube buttons
will add or replace exponents.  The Multiply and Divide buttons will add "*"
and "/" operators.</p>

<p>Similarly, clicking on a unit from the list replaces the unit closest to
the cursor in the active unit edit box.</p>

<p>The "Clear Unit" button below the unit text boxes may be used to empty the
unit edit window to allow a new unit to be entered.</p>

<p>The "Filter List" button can be used to show only one type of unit in the
list.  Note that this doesn't show units that could be combined to form a
type.</p>

<h3><a name="nonlinear"></a>Non-Linear Conversions</h3>

<p>The conversion of some units is non-linear.  Examples of these include the
Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales (due to an offset zero point) and
the American Wire Gauge (logarithmic).  The non-linear units are labeled as
such in the comments column.</p>

<p>These units can be converted only when they are not combined with other
units or used with an exponential operator.  Otherwise the conversion would
not be meaningful.</p>

<h3><a name="shortcut"></a>Shortcuts</h3>

<p>When typing unit names, spaces are ignored, so they may be skipped.  For
squared and cubed units (positive exponents of 2 or 3) the "^" symbol does not
need to be typed.</p>

<p>When a partially typed unit is highlighted (yellow) in the list, hitting
enter will complete the name.  The up an ddown arrow keys can be used to
highlight nearby units in the list prior to hitting enter.  The unit closet to
the cursor will be replaced.</p>

<p>The "Recent Unit" button opens a menu of recently used units and unit
combinations.  The current unit combination is replaced with any selections
from this menu.</p>

<p>The tab key can be used to cycle between the "From" and "To" unit test
boxes and the "From" and "To" number editors.</p>

<p>The number to be converted may be entered in either the "From" or "To" unit
side.  Standard or scientific notation may be used, or an expression including
the normal math operators (+, -, *, /, **) and parenthesis may be entered.</p>

<h3><a name="options"></a>Options</h3>

<p>The "Options" button allows for changing several default settings.  These
settings are automatically stored so that ConvertAll will load with the
settings last used.</p>

<p>The first options control the display of numerical results, including the
use of scientific notation and the number of decimal places.  Be cautious
about setting the number of decimal places to a low value, which can result in
a significant loss of accuracy.  Six places or higher is recommended (eight is
the default).</p>

<p>There is an option to set the number of recent units to be saved.  Setting
it to zero will disable the Recent Unit button.  Another option will
automatically load the most recent previous units at startup.</p>
